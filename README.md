### Computer Science

This is a contentious subject, and one I'm not well qualified to talk about. The general consensus however is that there are of course concepts bootcamp graduates would benefit to learn, at least at some point in their careers, though perhaps [some](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) more than others. 

I will eventually try [this](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/) course by FEM, but at the moment I don't think it's the best use of my time.
