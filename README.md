A collection of (mostly) free front end and JavaScript centric resources. Some, such as Front End Masters (FEM), are paid for, but if you're eligible for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) you get six months [free](https://frontendmasters.com/welcome/github-student-developers/)! 
<br><br>
I recommend starting [here](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).  I'll try to avoid adding too many resources simply because I think it's better to focus on a few (we don't want to get stuck in tutorial paralysis!) <strong>And finally, build as much as you can!</strong>

### Computer Science

A contentious topic, and one I'm not well qualified to talk about. The general consensus (i.e. what Reddit says) seems to be that there several important concepts to learn with [some](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) being more important than others. 

Personally, I will try [this](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/) course by FEM, but at the moment I don't think it's the best use of my time.
