# Front-End Resources

A collection of free front-end and JavaScript-centric resources. I recommend starting with this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) ðŸ’œ. You'll often see Udemy courses being recommended, and while I'm sure some of them are great, they cost money and there seems to be plenty of great free material out there so I won't bother mentioning them here. I'm a big fan of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) ðŸ’œ, but I'm a bit lost as to how best to navigate their resources a lot of the time. Regardless, it's still worth checking their site for any up-to-date guides. If you're just starting out, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is still a great place to start to familiarise yourself with the basics of coding; just bear in mind it's quite hand-holdy, and you'll want to complement your learning with basic coding challenges.

## React
A JavaScript library used to produce HTML from dynamic components. Start with the recently updated [docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) ðŸ’œ! I also think NextJS' brief [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react) is a great place to start. After that, you might want to consider looking in to frameworks, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 

#### React Setup
- [Vite Official](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)

But what about `Create React App`? Read [this](https://scrimba.com/articles/create-react-app-with-vite/) for why you might not want to use it. 
#### React Learning Resources
* [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) â€¢ ~11+ hrs ðŸ’œ
* [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) â€¢ ~2 Â½ <br>
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) <br>

#### Suggested React Projects
* [Portfolio](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) ðŸ’œ

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

### Hotwire (for Le Wagon students)
Turbo and Stimulus, if you're prefer to stick with something more Rails-y.

#### Hotwire Learning Resources
* [Hotrails](https://www.hotrails.dev/)
* Odin Project [Turbo Drive](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-turbo-drive) and [Turbo](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-turbo) pages ðŸ’œ

## Vanilla JavaScript
Just remember, you'll eventually want to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) but it's worth getting comfortable with JS first. 

#### Learning Resources
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
* [You Don't Know JS, Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

Another great resource is [Effective TypeScript](https://effectivetypescript.com/), though sadly it's not free. 

#### Technical Questions
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) ðŸ’œ
* Get comfortable with technical assessment sites like Code Signal, [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) and [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/) that are used by larger companies.

#### Please explain ... ðŸš§
* [classes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-classes-how-they-work-with-use-case/#what-are-classes-in-javascript)
* [time to interactive](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/)
* [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) â€¢ Video ðŸ’œ
* [callbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHneyv38Jro) â€¢ Video

#### Debugging ðŸš§

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

## Blogs
* [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) ðŸ’œ
> fantastically well explained tutorials, I can't recommend them enough (just be sure to check whether they've been updated recently)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

## Other

Start learning about and using ðŸ’œ [Docker](https://github.com/acantril/docker-fundamentals)! The official tutorial is also a great place to start. I also recommend these resources from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b/) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker) for written introductions to Docker. 

<p align="right"><a href="#top">up</a></p>

## Computer Science

A contentious topic for Bootcamp graduates, and one I don't feel well qualified to talk about. The general consensus (i.e. what Reddit says) seems to be that there several important concepts to learn with [some](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) being more important than others. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is probably a good place to start. Something more [targeted](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/) might a better use of one's time, however. There's also plenty of nice [free stuff](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) of course.
