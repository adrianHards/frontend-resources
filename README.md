# Front-End Resources (for Experienced Beginners)

A collection of free front-end, JavaScript-centric, resources. I recommend starting with this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) ðŸ’œ. You'll often see Udemy courses being recommended, and while they might be great, they cost money and there seems to be plenty of great free material out there so I won't mention them here.
<br>
<br>
ðŸ’œ's are reserved for resources I've used and recommend. If you find this page helpful, please give it a star! ðŸŒŸ <strong>And remember, build as much as you can!</strong>

## Computer Science

A contentious topic for Bootcamp graduates, and one I'm not well qualified to talk about. The general consensus (i.e. what Reddit says) seems to be that there several important concepts to learn with [some](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) being more important than others. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is probably a good place to start. Something more [targeted](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/) might a better use of one's time, however.
